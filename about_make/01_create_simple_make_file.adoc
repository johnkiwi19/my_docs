== Create a Simple Makefile

What is hapening here is
we are creating a directory called tmp.
We are also creating a make file in that directory.
Here is a list of commands that can be used
to create the make file

[source,bash]
----
rm -rf tmp
mkdir tmp/
cat << EOF > tmp/makefile
all:
    clear
    @echo "Hi there from tmp"
EOF

# Convert the spaces to tabs
sed -i 's/    /\t/g' tmp/makefile

# Run The file
(cd tmp && make)

# View The file
cat -e -t -v tmp/makefile


----


=== Add Tabs
[source,bash]
sed -i 's/    /\t/g' tmp/makefile

=== check the file for tabs
Makefile uses tabs.

When you copy a file from the web browser 
the browser will put spaces in the make file
instead of tabs.
What you can do is convert the spaces to tabs with the **sed** command.


==== view the File with cat
[source,bash]
cat -e -t -v tmp/makefile
**Output**

[source,bash]
----
[john@localhost about_make]$ cat -e -t -v tmp/makefile
all:$
^Iclear$
^I@echo "Hi there from tmp"$
[john@localhost about_make]$

meathords of checking wheather we are using tabs on the command line
